                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Renewable energy comes from a natural source that is theoretically inexhaustible, and
                                includes wind, solar, biomass, tidal, wave, and hydroelectric. Of these, solar is the
                                most versatile and simplest to site on a residence.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The electrification of the United States was accomplished in the 1920s and 1930s
                                through the development of centralized large-scale power plants and a network of
                                distribution power lines. Large hydroelectric facilities and nuclear power plants were
                                added to the grid through the 1960s and 1970s. All of the large power generating
                                facilities were designed to generate and sell power to the consumer, and the utilities
                                that own them are highly-regulated monopolies.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Changes to Federal energy policy in 1992 and 2005 encouraged renewable sources, and
                                allowed generation of power from sources such as wind and solar farms. This changed the
                                flow of electrons for the first time.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Small-scale solar remained a niche power source for off-grid use until the invention
                                of the grid-tied inverter, which synchronized solar power with utility grid power, and
                                allowed excess power at a residence to flow onto the grid. This ability to offset
                                utility bills fueled exponential growth in small residential systems, growing
                                distributed rather than centralized power production.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Battery storage of excess power is becoming more affordable and useful as a means of
                                backup power and/or a way to shift load to a less expensive time of day.</p></li>

                    <div class="FAQ">
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does solar PV work?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Sunlight hits the solar panels, where photons are converted to a direct
                            current (DC). The direct current is routed to an inverter, which changes it to alternating
                            current (AC). In a grid-tied system, the inverter locks onto the utility power and
                            frequency, and, if more power is being made than is being used, the power flows onto the
                            grid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is net metering?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> A qualified generation system must be allowed to push power onto the
                            grid. Net metering is the process of compensation for the owner of the generator. Different
                            utilities interpret net metering differently. In the PNM Small Solar Program, with
                            inverter(s) no larger than 10kW AC, power that is pushed onto the grid becomes a credit,
                            which may be used at a later date. The PNM Large Solar Program does not have the credit
                            carryover provision.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is a kilowatt hour?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> A kilowatt hour (kWh) is the basic unit of power consumption. Your
                            utility bill provides a total of how many kWh you used in a month. A kilowatt (kW) is 1,000
                            watts, and a kilowatt hour is 1,000 watts of power used for one hour. It may be compared to
                            ten 100-watt lamps on for one hour.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How are PV systems sized?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> A PV system is generally sized in kilowatts (kW) of DC power. The size in
                            watts of each panel times the number of panels divided by 1000 is the kW size of a system.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I know how much PV I need?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Within the PNM Small PV Program, the economic sweet spot is an offset of
                            all of your annual use, or a bit less. First total twelve months of your monthly usage in
                            kWh to get your annual usage. A good rule of thumb in the Albuquerque area is that a PV
                            system will produce 5 kWh per DC kW of system size per day. Divide the total annual kWh by
                            5, then by 365 to come up with an estimated of the size in DC kW. For example, the average
                            PNM customer averages 600 kWh/month, so 12 X 600 = 7200 kWh/year. 7200 / 5 / 365 = 3.94 kW.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can't I oversize my system and have PNM pay me for power?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> It does not work out economically to oversize, under either of PNM's
                            Solar Programs. With the Small Program, you wind up with a credit that is only good if you
                            use it, and with the Large Program, you are paid for excess power at PNM's wholesale cost.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much does a PV system cost?</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The cost of a PV system depends on a few factors, such as the price of
                            panels, the type of mount, and the type of inverter(s). Premium high-efficiency panels can
                            be expensive, and are best used where space for panels is limited. Any roof mount is less
                            expensive than a ground mount, and flush mounts on a pitched roof are less expensive than
                            ballast mounts on a flat roof. Microinverters are cost effective for a small system, but
                            become much more expensive than string inverters in large system. Large systems in general
                            are less expensive per watt than small systems. A ballpark working number would be in the
                            range of $2.25 to $3.25/watt.</p>
